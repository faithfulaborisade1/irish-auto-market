## Tips & Best Practices

### üéØ Getting Image URLs Fast
1. **Use browser DevTools** (F12):
   - Go to Network tab
   - Click on image
   - Right-click on image request ‚Üí Copy URL

2. **Use browser extensions**:
   - "Image Downloader" - shows all images with URLs
   - "Copy All Image URLs" - one-click copy

3. **Right-click method**:
   - Right-click image ‚Üí "Open image in new tab"
   - Copy URL from address bar

### üìù CSV Formatting
- Always use quotes around text with commas: `"BMW 320i, M Sport"`
- Use `|` for multiple values (images, features)
- Keep one header row
- No blank rows between entries

### ‚ö° Performance
- Upload in batches of 20-50 cars
- Maximum 100 cars per upload
- Each batch processes 10 cars at a time
- Total time: ~30 seconds per car (including image processing)

### üîç Validation
Before upload, check:
- All required fields filled
- At least 1 image URL per car
- Valid image URLs (end with .jpg, .png, .webp)
- Price and year are numbers
- County names match Irish counties

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to process images"
**Cause:** Image URL is invalid or blocked
**Fix:**
- Verify URL works in browser
- Try right-clicking ‚Üí "Copy Image Address" again
- Some sites block direct downloads - save image locally and use Individual upload

### "Maximum 10 images allowed"
**Fix:** Remove excess images (keep best 10)

### "Validation failed"
**Cause:** Missing required fields
**Fix:** Check error message, add missing data

### Images not appearing
**Cause:**
- URL requires authentication
- URL expired (temporary links)
- Site blocks hotlinking

**Fix:**
- Use permanent image URLs
- For protected images, download manually and use Individual upload

### CSV parsing errors
**Cause:** Incorrect format
**Fix:**
- Download fresh template
- Check for extra commas
- Ensure proper quoting

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints
1. **`/api/admin/cars/process-image-urls`**
   - Downloads images from URLs
   - Uploads to Cloudinary
   - Returns optimized image data

2. **`/api/admin/cars/bulk-create`**
   - Creates multiple cars
   - Processes image URLs
   - Handles batching and transactions

### Image Processing
- Downloads with proper User-Agent headers
- Validates image type and size
- Uploads to Cloudinary folder: `irish_auto_market/cars`
- Generates 3 versions:
  - Thumbnail: 150x150px
  - Medium: 500x400px
  - Large: 800x600px
- Preserves full image (object-contain, no cropping)

### Smart Defaults Logic
- **Body Type Detection**: Analyzes model name for keywords (SUV, Van, etc.)
- **Transmission**: Auto for 2020+, Manual for older
- **Doors/Seats**: Based on body type (SUV = 5 doors, Saloon = 4 doors)
- **Title Generation**: Auto-generates from year/make/model if missing
